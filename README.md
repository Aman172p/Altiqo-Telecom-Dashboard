 Our recent Power BI dashboard analysis provides critical insights into the performance of our telecommunications services post-5G launch. While revenue generation remains strong in key cities, there are alarming trends that require immediate attention to ensure long-term customer retention and brand health.

Key Insights:

Revenue Concentration:

The top five cities contribute 60% of our overall revenue. This highlights the importance of these markets, yet it also signals a risk if trends continue to decline.
Declining Active Users:

Cities such as Delhi and Chennai are experiencing a negative trend in active users following the 5G launch. This decline is concerning, as these cities are pivotal to our revenue stream. We must consider targeted marketing campaigns to re-engage these customers.
Increase in Unsubscribed Users:

There has been a drastic rise in the number of unsubscribed users post-5G. This trend could lead to negative publicity, impacting our brand image and overall market position. Addressing this issue is crucial to maintaining customer loyalty.
Revenue vs. Active Users:

While we have observed a decrease in both revenue and active users since the 5G rollout, the average revenue per user (ARPU) has risen by 11.05%. This indicates that our pricing strategies may be driving away customers, despite generating higher revenue from those who remain. We need to reassess our pricing structure to find a more appealing balance.
Inactivity in Key Revenue Cities:

Although cities like Delhi, Ahmedabad, Patna, and Raipur generate significant revenue, they are also witnessing a rise in inactive users. This dual trend necessitates a comprehensive strategy to retain existing customers while attracting new ones.
